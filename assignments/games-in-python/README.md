# 📘 Assignment: Games in Python

## 🎯 Objective

Build a classic Hangman word-guessing game using Python strings, loops, and user input to practice fundamental programming concepts including string manipulation, conditionals, and random selection.

## 📝 Tasks

### 🛠️	Create Basic Hangman Game

#### Description
Develop a Hangman game where players guess letters to reveal a hidden word before running out of attempts. The game should provide an interactive experience with clear feedback on each guess.

#### Requirements
Completed program should:

- Randomly select words from a predefined list of at least 10 words
- Display the word as underscores initially (e.g., "_ _ _ _ _")
- Accept single letter guesses from the user
- Update the display to show correctly guessed letters
- Track and display remaining incorrect guesses
- Show all previously guessed letters
- End the game when the word is fully guessed (win) or attempts are exhausted (lose)
- Display appropriate win/lose messages with the correct word

### 🛠️	Add Game Enhancements

#### Description
Enhance the basic Hangman game with additional features to improve user experience and demonstrate advanced programming skills.

#### Requirements
Completed program should:

- Validate user input (only accept single letters, handle uppercase/lowercase)
- Prevent duplicate guesses and inform the user
- Display a simple hangman ASCII art that updates with each wrong guess
- Allow the player to play multiple rounds
- Keep track of wins and losses across multiple games
- Include word categories (animals, foods, etc.) for variety
